Abstract
Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant cause of premature mortality worldwide, with a growing
burden in recent years. Despite this, there is a lack of comprehensive meta-analyses that quantify the extent of premature
CVD mortality. Study addressed this gap by estimating the pooled age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR)
of premature CVD mortality.
Methods We conducted a systematic review of published CVD mortality studies that reported ASMR as an indicator
for premature mortality measurement. All English articles published as of October 2022 were searched in four
electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL). We computed pooled estimates of ASMR using random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed heterogeneity
from the selected studies using the I2
statistic. Subgroup analyses and meta regression analysis was performed
based on sex, main CVD types, income country level, study time and age group. The analysis was performed using R
software with the “meta” and “metafor” packages.
Results A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The estimated global ASMR for premature mortality from total
CVD was 96.04 per 100,000 people (95% CI: 67.18, 137.31). Subgroup analysis by specific CVD types revealed a higher
ASMR for ischemic heart disease (ASMR = 15.57, 95% CI: 11.27, 21.5) compared to stroke (ASMR = 12.36, 95% CI:
8.09, 18.91). Sex-specific differences were also observed, with higher ASMRs for males (37.50, 95% CI: 23.69, 59.37)
than females (15.75, 95% CI: 9.61, 25.81). Middle-income countries had a significantly higher ASMR (90.58, 95% CI:
56.40, 145.48) compared to high-income countries (21.42, 95% CI: 15.63, 29.37). Stratifying by age group indicated
that the age groups of 20–64 years and 30–74 years had a higher ASMR than the age group of 0–74 years. Our multivariable
meta-regression model suggested significant differences in the adjusted ASMR estimates for all covariates
except study time
